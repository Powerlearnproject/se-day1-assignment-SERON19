Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  This is the process of applying engineering principles of software development by designing 
  ,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software products.It's importance includes 
   commerce for ecommerce,communications and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
   Fortran,C,Java,Javascript and Python.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   Planning this defines project scope ,objectives and requirements.
  Requirement analysis.Implies to gathering and define user needs and functional requirements
  Design entails creating  high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and 
  user interface
  Implementation this is building of software as per the functional requirement  through coding.
  Testing at this phase software is subjected to various test to ensure it meets quality 
  standards.
  Deployment releasing the software to clients.
  Maintenance this is providing support ,updates and enhancements support after software 
  deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next while Agile methodologies Iterative and incremental approach, where work is completed in short cycles (sprints).
Examples are;
A financial institution needs to upgrade its legacy banking system. Requirements at this scenario are well defined.
A technology startup is developing a new mobile app.With this requirements are acquired from customer feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer responsible for implementation of software solutions through coding.
Quality Assurance Engineer designing and executing test plans  hence ensuring software quality.
Project Manager Oversees the planning ,execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments  eg IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio  helps in code writting providing debugging tools and automation capabilities while Version Control Systems like Git enhance productivity  and collaboration.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Changing requirement and time constraints.Breaking down projects into iterative sprints to adapt to changing requirements and reduce stress.Creating well-defined task lists and allocating time appropriately.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is testing of software units  eg classes ,modules  hence ensuring  that each unit  performs its intended functions as expected
Integration Testing involves intergrated modules and components   
testing to verify their functionality and interaction
System Testing  involves test of whole software system verifying overall performance,functionality and its reliability ensuring system meets user requirements.
Acceptance Testing this is test done by clients to validate software against their acceptance criteria.This help reduce rusk of user rejection after deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is about crafting  instructions and questions in a way that helps get best responses from robot or AI assistant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt is like asking AI to write summary of a novel in this case you are not clear to which novel  you want not also specific to the novel  and not concise
